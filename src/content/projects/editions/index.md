Editions is a self-hosted news reader that takes a different approach to RSS: instead of an infinite scroll, it assembles feeds into finite, curated "magazines" with reading-time budgets and per-source limits.

## How it works

- **Sources** — subscribe to any RSS feed
- **Focuses** — define topics using natural language descriptions
- **Editions** — create magazine configs with per-section article budgets and reading-time limits
- **Source budgeting** — prevent any single feed from dominating a section

Classification is powered by zero-shot NLI via Hugging Face Transformers.js, running entirely on-device. Nothing phones home.

## Additional features

- **Ranked feed** — a traditional feed view with voting that propagates through semantic similarity
- **Bookmarks** — save articles for later
- **Single container** — ships as one Docker image with Node.js, Fastify, SQLite, and the React frontend
