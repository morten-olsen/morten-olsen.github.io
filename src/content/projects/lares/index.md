Lares is a system management daemon that pairs AI agents with declarative Nix configuration to automate OS management safely. It accepts conversational commands and translates them into atomic, reversible system changes.

## Features

- **Nix-backed safety** — atomic rebuilds that either fully succeed or fail cleanly, no partial installations
- **Rollback** — undo any agent action with a single command via git reversion and Nix generation rollback
- **Full audit trail** — every change is a signed git commit with the agent's reasoning and diff
- **Declarative config** — functional configuration turns autonomous actions into safe, reproducible automation
- **CLI-first** — conversational interface for system tasks like package installation, theming, network policy, and diagnostics
