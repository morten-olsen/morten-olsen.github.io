Morten joined the frontend team at Trendsales as a very young developer and immediately it became clear that he is the kind of rock star developer you dream of managing; passionate, thirsty for learning, and exceptionally talented. Any task given, no matter how challenging, he would complete in record time and at a level far beyond expectations. And he manages to do this while always remaining humble, generous, and an overall fun guy to be around.

I heartily give Morten my best possible recommendation and frankly hope we will work together again in the future.
