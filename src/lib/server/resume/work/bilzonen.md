I work as a part-time web developer on bilzonen.dk. I have worked with both day-to-day maintenance and large scale projects (new search module, integration of new data catalog, mobile site, new-car-catalog and the entire dealer solution). The page is an Umbraco solution, with all .NET (C#) code. I have introduced a new custom build provider-model system, which allows data-providers to move data between data stores, external services, and the site. (search, caching and external car date is running through the provider system). Also, i have set up the development environment, from setting up virtual server hosts to building custom tool for building and unit testing.
