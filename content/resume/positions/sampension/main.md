Sampension is a danish pension fund and my work has been to design and help to build a frontend architecture that would run natively on iOS and Android as well as on the web on both desktop and mobile devices.

It was important to ensure that the project felt at home on all platforms and that it was maintainable by a small team of developers.

To achieve this we used React Native and React Native for Web to create a unified codebase for all platforms, as well as create a component library which would deal with ensuring the best UX on all platforms.
