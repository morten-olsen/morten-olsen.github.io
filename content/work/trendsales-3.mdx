summary: In 2015, I spearheaded the creation of a new frontend architecture for Trendsales, leading to the development of m.trendsales.dk, using React and Redux, and devising bespoke frameworks for navigation, flexible routing, skeleton page transitions, and integrating workflows across systems like Github, Jira, Octopus Deploy, AppVeyor, and Docker.

In 2015 Trendsales decided to build an entirely new platform. It became my responsibility to create a modernized frontend architecture. The work began in 2016 with just me on the project and consisted of a proof of concept version containing everything from framework selection, structure, style guides build chain, continuous deployment, and an actual initial working version. The result where the platform which I was given technical ownership over and which I, along with two others, worked on expanding over the next year. The platform is currently powering _m.trendsales.dk_. The project is build using React and state management are done using Redux. In addition to the of the shelve frameworks, we also needed to develop quite a few bespoke frameworks, in order to meet demands. Among others, these were created to solve the following issues:

- Introducing a new navigational paradigm
- Create a more flexible routing mechanism
- Be able to serve skeleton page, for page transitions while still being able to create complete server-side pages
- Ensure project flows between multiple systems such as Github, Jira, Octopus Deploy, AppVeyor and Docker
