I became responsible for the iOS platform, which was a task that required a new app to be built from the ground up using _Xamarin_. In addition to that, a new API to support the app along with support for our larger vendors was needed which had to be build using something closely similar to _Microsoft MVC_ so that other people could join the project at a later stage.

he project started in October with the initial version available to our users in late December.

This project represented my first adventure into mobile development and became an app with more than 15 million screen views and 1.5 million sessions per month.

After that, I joined two other colleagues, who were working on an Android version of the app, to form a join mobile development team.

Throughout the period I also worked on the backend for the web page from time to time.
