tagline: Hi, I'm Morten And I make software
about: |
  Hell bend on a conquest to take over
  the digital world (and the physical,
  should the chance arise). Am I over
  ambitious? Perhaps, but with a
  proven track record in most aspects
  of things which can process 1s and
  0s and a mind which runs at a speed
  which can battle a well-trained race-
  horse, I believe I am equipt to un-
  dertake this voyage!
