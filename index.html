Initially, I was hired to help build the frontend and the architecture of their new digital self-service product (&quot;Sampension&quot; on Apple App Store or Google Play Store).</p>
<p>The project was to create a single code base that could handle both iOS, Android and web and be responsive/adaptive to be able to give a great UX on both mobile, tablets as well as desktop computers. The product is created using React Native and React Native Web and currently has around 96% shared code between the different platforms.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have been working on CI/CD and various DevOps related tasks to build up the tooling around the product (AWS S3, AWS Lambda, AWS Cloudfront, Github, Github Actions, Azure DevOps, Azure, etc.)</p>
<p>I am also currently working with some initial project analysis for new projects and I have begun maintaining some of our backend code (C#)</p></div><div class="experiences__More-sc-1evy0ik-9 gwNFkK">Show <!-- -->more</div></div></div></div><div class="experiences__Outer-sc-1evy0ik-2 bMsPtc"><div class="experiences__ExperienceWrapper-sc-1evy0ik-3 dRUaQU"><div class="experiences__Inner-sc-1evy0ik-4 VqyCM" style="opacity:0;transform:translateY(50px) scale(1.3) translateZ(0)"><h5 class="experiences__CompanyName-sc-1evy0ik-5 iVHZVa">Trendsales</h5><h4 class="experiences__JobTitle-sc-1evy0ik-6 gpvJzW">Frontend Technical Lead</h4><div class="experiences__Time-sc-1evy0ik-7 kyVtFr">2016<!-- --> - <!-- -->2018</div><div style="max-height:0;opacity:0" class="experiences__Hidden-sc-1evy0ik-10 TUpPX"><p>In 2015 Trendsales decided to build an entirely new platform. It became my responsibility to create a modernized frontend architecture. The work began in 2016 with just me on the project and consisted of a proof of concept version containing everything from framework selection, structure, style guides build chain, continuous deployment, and an actual initial working version. The result where the platform which I was given technical ownership over and which I, along with two others, worked on expanding over the next year. The platform is currently powering <em>m.trendsales.dk</em>.</p>
<p>The project is build using React and state management are done using Redux. In addition to the of the shelve frameworks, we also needed to develop quite a few bespoke frameworks, in order to meet demands. Among others, these were created to solve the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing a new navigational paradigm</li>
<li>Create a more flexible routing mechanism</li>
<li>Be able to serve skeleton page, for page transitions while still being able to create complete server-side pages</li>
<li>Ensure project flows between multiple systems such as Github, Jira, Octopus Deploy, AppVeyor and Docker</li>

<p>In addition to that, a new API to support the app along with support for our larger vendors was needed which had to be build using something closely similar to <em>Microsoft MVC</em> so that other people could join the project at a later stage.</p>
<p>The project started in October with the initial version available to our users in late December.</p>

Still, I did reasonably go through the hiring process when looking for a new job so that I will mix a bit from both sides for this article, so you get both some experience from hires and what worked and experience from the other side of the table and what caused my not to consider a company, because spoiler alert: Engineers are contacted a lot!\n\nSo first I need to introduce a hard truth as this will be underpining a lot of my points and is most likely the most important take away from this: Your company is not unique\n\nUnless your tech brand is among the X highest regarded in the world, your company alone isn't a selling point. I have been contacted by so many companies which thought because they were leader in their field or had a \"great product\" that makes candidates come banging at their door. If I could disclose all those messages it would be really easy to see that except for the order of information all says almost the same thing, and chances are you job listing is the same. Sorry.\nThe take away from this is that if everything is equal any misstep in your hiring process can cost you that candidate, so if you are not amongst the strongest of tech brands you need to be extremely aware or you will NOT fill the position\n\nOkay after that slap in the face we can take a second to look at something...\n\nA lot of people focuses on skills when hirering, and of cause the candidate should have the skills for the position, but I will make a case to put less focus on the hard skills and more focus on passion.\n\nUsually screening skills through an interview is hard and techniques like code challenges has their own issues, but more on that later.\nScreening for passion is easier, usually you can get a good feeling if a candidate is passionate about a specific topic, and passionate people want to learn! So even if the candidate has limited skills, if they have passion they will learn and they will outgrow a candidate with experience but no passion.\nFilling a team with technically skills can solve an immediate requirement, but companies, teams and products change, your requirements will change along with it. Building a passionate team will adjust and evolve along where a product where a team consisting of skilled people but without passion will stay where they where when you hired them.\n\nAnother issue I see in many job postings is requiring a long list of skills. It would be awesome to find someone skilled in everything and who could solve all tasks. In the real world, when ever you add another skill to that list you are limiting the list of candidates that would fit so chances are you are not going to find anyone or the actual skills of any candidate in that very narrow list will be way lower than in a wider pool.\nA better way is to just add the most important skills, and learn the candidate any less important skills at the job. If you hired passionate people this should be possible (remember to screen for passion about learning new things)\n\nWhile we are on the expected skill list: A lot of companies has this list of \"it would be really nice if you had these skills\". Well those could definitely be framed as learning experiences instead. If you have recruited passionate people, seeing that you will learn new cool skills count as a plus and any candidate who already have the skill will see it and think \"awesome, I am already uniquely suited for the job!\"\n\nI promised to talk a bit about code challenges: They can be useful to screen a candidates ability to just go in and start to work from day one, and if done correctly can help a manager organise their process to best suit the teams unique skills but...\nHiring at the moment is hard! And as stated pretty much any job listing I have seen are identical, so as in a competitive job market where a small outlier on your resumé lands you in the pile never read through, as likely is it in a competitive hiring market that your listing never gets acted upon.\nEngineers are contacted a lot by recruiters and speaking to all would require a lot of work so if a company has a prolonged process it quickly gets sorted out, especially by the best candidates whom most likely get contacted the most and most likely have a full time job so time is a scarce resource.\nSo be aware that if you use time consuming processes such as the code challenge you might miss out on the best candidates.\n\n![](/\\_next/static/images/img1-ba726423aebe5c39cc4be86cd06c48d4.png)\n\nPlease just disclose the salary range. From being connected to a few hundred recruiters here on LinkedIn I can see that this isn't just me but a general issue. As mentioned before, it takes very little to have your listings ignored and most likely most of your strongest potential candidates already has full time jobs, and would not want to move to a position paying less unless the position where absolutely unique (which again, yours most likely isn't). Therefore if you choose not to disclose the salary range be aware that you miss out on most of the best candidates. A company will get an immediate no from me if not disclosing the salary range.\n\nLastly, I have spend a lot of words telling your that your company or position isn't unique, and well we both know that is not accurate, your company most likely has something unique to offer! Be that soft values or hard benefits. Be sure to put them in your job listing, to bring out this uniqueness, it is what is going to set you apart from the other listing. There are lot of other companies with the same tech stack, using an agile approach, with a high degree of autonomy, with a great team... But what can you offer that no one else can? Get it front and center...

Redux has a declarative state derived through a \"reducer\"-function. This reducer function takes in the current state and an event, and, based on that event, it gives back an updated state. So you have an initial state inside Redux, and then you dispatch events into it, each getting the current state and updating it. That means that the resulting state will always be the same given the same set of events.\n\nSo why is a framework primarily used to keep track of application state for React-based frontends a good fit for a smart home? Well, your smart home platform most likely closely mimics this architecture already!\n\nFirst, an event goes in, such as a motion sensor triggering, or you set the bathroom light to 75% brightness in the interface. This event then goes into the platform and hits some automation or routine, resulting in an update request getting sent to the correct devices, which then change the state to correspond to the new state.\n\n...But that is not quite what happens on most platforms. Deterministic events may go into the system, but this usually doesn't cause a change to a deterministic state. Instead, it gets dispatched to the device, the devices updates, the platform sees this change, and then it updates its state to represent that new state.\n\nThis distinction is essential because it comes with a few drawbacks:\n\n*   Because the event does not change the state but sends a request to the device that does it, everything becomes asynchronous and can happen out of order. This behaviour can be seen either as an issue or a feature, but it does make integrating with it a lot harder from a technical point of view.\n*   The request is sent to the device as a \"fire-and-forget\" event. It then relies on the success of that request and the subsequent state change to be reported back from the device before the state gets updated. This behaviour means that if this request fails (something you often see with ZigBee-based devices), the device and the state don't get updated.\n*   Since the device is responsible for reporting the state change, you are dependent on having that actual device there to make the change. Without sending the changes to the actual device, you cannot test the setup.\n\nSo can we create a setup that gets away from these issues?\n\nAnother thing to add here is more terminology/philosophy, but most smart home setups are, in my opinion, not really smart, just connected and, to some extent, automated. I want a design that has some actual smartness to it. In this article, I will outline a setup closer to that of the connected, automated home, and at the end, I will give some thoughts on how to take this to the next level and make it smart.\n\nWe know what we want to achieve, and Redux can help us solve this. Remember that Redux takes actions and applies them in a deterministic way to produce a deterministic state.\n\nTime to go a bit further down the React rabbit hole because another thing from React-land comes in handy here: the concept of reconciliation.\n\nInstead of dispatching events to the devices waiting for them to update and report their state back, we can rely on reconciliation to update our device. For example, let's say we have a device state for our living room light that says it is at 80% brightness in our Redux store. So now we dispatch an event that sets it to 20% brightness.\n\nInstead of sending this event to the device, we update the Redux state.\n\nWe have a state listener that detects when the state changes and compares it to the state of the actual device. In our case, it seems that the state indicates that the living room light should be at 20% but are, in fact, at 80%, so it sends a request to the actual device to update it to the correct value.\n\nWe can also do schedule reconciliation to compare our Redux state to that of the actual devices. If a device fails to update its state after a change, it will automatically get updated on our next scheduled run, ensuring that our smart home devices always reflect our state.\n\n*Sidenote: Yes, of course, I have done a proof of concept using React with a home build reconciliation that reflected the virtual dom unto physical devices, just to have had a house that ran React-Redux*\n\nLet's go through our list of issues with how most platforms handle this. We can see that we have eliminated all of them by switching to this Redux-reconciliation approach: we update the state directly to run it synchronously. We can re-run the reconciliation so failed or dropped device updates get re-run. We don't require any physical devices as our state is directly updated.\n\nWe now have a robust, reliable, state management mechanism for our smart home, time to add some smarts to it. It is a little outside the article's main focus as this is just my way of doing it; there may be way better ways, so use it at your discretion.\n\nRedux has the concept of middlewares which are stateful functions that live between the event going into Redux and the reducer updating the state. These middlewares allow Redux to deal with side effects and do event transformations.\n\nTime for another piece of my smart home philosophy: Most smart homes act on events, and I have used the word throughout this article, but to me, events are not the most valuable thing when creating a smart home, instead I would argue that the goal is to deal with intents rather than events. For instance, an event could be that I started to play a video on the TV. But, that state a fact, what we want to do is instead capture what I am trying to achieve, the \"intent\", so lets split this event into two intents; if the video is less than one hour, I want to watch a TV show, if it is more I want to watch a movie.\n\nThese intents allow us to not deal with weak-meaning events to do complex operations but instead split our concern into two separate concepts: intent classification and intent execution.\n\nSo last thing we need is a direct way of updating devices, as we can not capture everything through our intent classifier. For instance, if I sit down to read a book that does not generate any sensor data for our system to react to, I will still need a way to adjust device states manually. (I could add a button that would dispatch a reading intent)\n\nI have separated the events going into Redux into two types:\n\n*   control events, which directly controls a device\n*   environment events represent sensor data coming in (push on a button, motion sensor triggering, TV playing, etc.)\n\nNow comes the part I have feared, where I need to draw a diagram.\n\n...sorry\n\n![Image description](/\\_next/static/images/graph-b0591cd24193b4196cc80a447a08f09c.png)\n\nSo this shows our final setup.\n\nEvents go into our Redux setup, either environment or control.\n\nControl events go straight to the reducer, and the state is updated.\n\nEnvironment events first go to the intent classifier, which uses previous events, the current state, and the incoming event to derive the correct intent. The intent then goes into our intent executor, which converts the intent into a set of actual device changes, which gets sent to our reducer, and the state is then updated.\n\nLastly, we invoke the reconciliation to update our real devices to reflect our new state.\n\nThere we go! Now we have ended up with a self-contained setup. We can run it without the reconciliation or mock it to create tests for our setup and work without changing any real devices, and we can re-run the reconciliation on our state to ensure our state gets updated correctly, even if a device should miss an update.\n\n**Success!!!**\n\nBut I promised to give an idea of how to take this smart home and make it actually \"smart.\"\n\nLet's imagine that we did not want to \"program\" our smart home. Instead, we wanted to use it; turning the lights on and off using the switches when we entered and exited a room, dimming the lights for movie time, and so on, and over time we want our smart home to pick up on those routines and start to do them for us.\n\nWe have a setup where we both have control events and environments coming in. Control events represent how we want the state of our home to be in a given situation. Environment events represent what happened in our home. So we could store those historically with some machine learning and look for patterns.\n\nLet's say you always dim the light when playing a movie that is more than one hour long; your smart home would be able to recognize this pattern and automatically start to do this routine for you.\n\nWould this work? I don't know. I am trying to get more skilled at machine learning to find out.\n","shareImage":null,"stats":{"text":"9 min read","minutes":8.05,"time":483000,"words":1610},"pdfs":{"a4":"/_next/static/images/828e42955452b3b3bd690c8f7778fa62/doc.pdf"}}],"experiences":[{"company":{"name":"ZeroNorth","website":"https://www.zeronorth.com"},"title":"Senior software engineer","startDate":"2021","id":"zeronorth","content":""},{"company":{"name":"Sampension","website":"https://www.sampension.dk"},"title":"Senior Frontend Developer","startDate":"2018-01","endDate":"2020-12","id":"sampension","content":"Sampension is a danish pension fund.\nInitially, I was hired to help build the frontend and the architecture of their new digital self-service product (\"Sampension\" on Apple App Store or Google Play Store).\n\nThe project was to create a single code base that could handle both iOS, Android and web and be responsive/adaptive to be able to give a great UX on both mobile, tablets as well as desktop computers.
