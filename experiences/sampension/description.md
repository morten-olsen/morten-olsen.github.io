Sampension is a danish pension fund.
Initially, I was hired to help build the frontend and the architecture of their new digital self-service product ("Sampension" on Apple App Store or Google Play Store).

The project was to create a single code base that could handle both iOS, Android and web and be responsive/adaptive to be able to give a great UX on both mobile, tablets as well as desktop computers. The product is created using React Native and React Native Web and currently has around 96% shared code between the different platforms.

Additionally, I have been working on CI/CD and various DevOps related tasks to build up the tooling around the product (AWS S3, AWS Lambda, AWS Cloudfront, Github, Github Actions, Azure DevOps, Azure, etc.)

I am also currently working with some initial project analysis for new projects and I have begun maintaining some of our backend code (C#)
