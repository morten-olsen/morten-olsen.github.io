So as a developer, the only thing I need to keep track of is that my Git refs are pointing to the right stuff. Everything else is reconciliation that I don't have to worry about - unless it is unreconcilable - and in which case, I will get alerted.

As someone responsible for the infrastructure, the only thing I need to keep track of is that the expected state matches the actual state.

No more multi-tool lookup, complex log dives or timeline reconstruction (until something fails, of course)

I believe that the switch from Git being just the code to being the code state makes a lot of daily tasks more straightforward and more transparent, builds a more resilient infrastructure and is worth considering when deciding how you want to do Git.
