The work began in 2016 with just me on the project and consisted of a proof of concept version containing everything from framework selection, structure, style guides build chain, continuous deployment, and an actual initial working version. The result where the platform which I was given technical ownership over and which I, along with two others, worked on expanding over the next year. The platform is currently powering _m.trendsales.dk_. The project is build using React and state management are done using Redux. In addition to the of the shelve frameworks, we also needed to develop quite a few bespoke frameworks, in order to meet demands. Among others, these were created to solve the following issues:\n\n* Introducing a new navigational paradigm\n* Create a more flexible routing mechanism\n* Be able to serve skeleton page, for page transitions while still being able to create complete server-side pages\n* Ensure project flows between multiple systems such as Github, Jira, Octopus Deploy, AppVeyor and Docker"
